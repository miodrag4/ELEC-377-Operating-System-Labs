//Testing Approach

/*The tests were performed on a student netid and using the root to see the differences in UID output.The UIDs and GIDs can be mapped to real names by the 
files /etc/passwd and /etc/group. The output indicates that when using root, UID and GID will be assigned 0. The output also shows that when using the netid 
20mcs, the UID should be 1007 and when using netid 19kodc it should be 1008. These outputs match the output when testing our code, therefore confirming that 
our outputs are correct.*/  


//Using the cat/dd command and cat//more command
//When using the cat and dd command the Name output is changed to dd. In contrast, when using the cat and more command, the output for Name is more.
