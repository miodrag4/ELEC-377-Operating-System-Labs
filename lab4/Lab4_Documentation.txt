//The goal of lab 4 was to separate and summarize the time span of traces from the threaded simulation of a distributed machine monitor written in lab 2. In order to complete this task, much reference was found from the man command in the command terminal. The first step was to determine if the file logsplit was executable using an if condition statement and using the echo command to generate corresponding messages based on what is returned. Subsequently, the extraction of the lines ending with R was completed using a grep command and saved to a new file $1.Reader. Similarly, printer traces were extracted using grep and saved to a file called $1.Printer. The next part of the lab was to extract monitor traces. The previous grep command was modified to find the number of machines by switching the previous R or P for digits between 0 to 5 and a cut and sort commands were also piped together in this expression to extract the 8th byte of every line and to find the number of unique monitors in order, respectively. A for loop was used to extract the lines for a monitor into a corresponding file. The final step of the lab was to compute the time span of the traces. Variables were created, readerHead and readerTail, that used the head and tail commands respectively to get the last lines of the file. The second and use portions of the lines were extracted using a cut command and then a second cut command was piped to the first to eliminate the period between the second and used portions. These steps were performed for printer ranges as well.
