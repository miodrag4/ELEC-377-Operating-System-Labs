Documentation 2/3
    You didn't really explain the chain of events that set up /proc/lab1.
Code Correctness 3/3
    Looks like you copied Lab0 into this lab and forgot to remove it...
    You should be checking if proc_create returns NULL and returning -ENOMEM if so.
    Looks good!
Code Clarity 2/2
    The best practice is not to captialize variable and function names in c.
Testing 2/2
    Good diversity of tests!
